## What is KIRun?

Is it a DSL?
Is it a state machine api?
Is it an interpreter?
Is it a programming instruction set?

I would say my objective in building this is runtime is to say YES!!! to all of the above questions.

Every other state machine or visual representation of a program or a state is all based on automata state machines. It is difficult for people to understand the complexities of writing a state machine in another programming language. Even the visual representation of the said machine is not so easy to comprehend. My goal here is to come up with the set of rules written for a definition or meta definition of a program that can be written in a structured way rather than in a programming language. In other words, define a JSON which will be executed to obtain certain result. All the operations, expression, calls, features and scopes everything will be defined in JSON to be executed on different programming languages.

## What is the benifit?

We can provide a easy to integrate visual tool create such definition/program. You can store the definition anywhere you want to run on your JAVA environment or JS environments or anyother programming languages. This will be programming language agnostic and can be extended to allow any set of interpretations because we will be boiling down everything to simple function executions.

BYOO(Bring Your Own Objects) and provide it to the runtime and you define the DSL. Strap on a security context you have user context. Add more functions to the existing set to define your problem set.

## What is the status?

This project is just started and initiated and have to work on many things to bring any simple practical release. Will keep you posted and updated on this here...
