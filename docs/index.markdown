# What is Kinetic Instruction Runtime

It is easy to show rather than write a thousand statements about the idea or the product even then I am attempting to provide a brief introduction.

The idea here is to take a JSON to understand and execute whatever it is in it, nothing more or less. The crux is to provide the meta definition or schema for the JSON.

There will be quite many posts following up to show how to solve real-world problems with this idea or framework.

## Example

The following JSON provides you idea of how to generate fibonacci numbers and added them to an array.

```json
{
  "asdf": "asdf",
  "asdf": "asdf"
}
```

Please check the [demo](/demo) to understand more
