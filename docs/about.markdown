# About

My name is **Kiran Kumar Grandhi**. I have been developing applications for 15 years in various domains on multiple platforms, all along I had trouble providing a window for an end-user to edit a piece of logic here or there. I recently had a lot of time to think while recovering from COVID-19 while lying on the bed. It gave me a thought about why not define language simple enough to build in JSON.

The objective of this deceptively simple initiative is to understand the structured JSON input and execute it as instructions of a program. But more you put your thought about it, the more fascinating it appears and becomes. An unstructured text called a program fed to an interpreter or a compiler it starts breaking it into meaningful tokens and try to execute. I am here trying to keep it simple using a structured JSON map with pre-defined operations. A user can easily edit this JSON map with a simple visual tool to change the course of execution.

This initiative will be managed by very few people to showcase the idea. The code will be available in the repository for others to access and run and see and use the code where and when wanted. Maybe, later we shall make it as a library to be used as a module.
